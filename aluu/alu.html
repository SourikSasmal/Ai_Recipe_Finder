    <div class="info">A recipe finder app is designed to help users discover new dishes based on the ingredients they have at hand. By simply entering the ingredients into the app, users can receive a list of recipes they can easily prepare,
       with suggestions ranked by ease, preparation time, and the number of additional ingredients required. The app makes it even more convenient by offering filters for quick recipes or those requiring minimal ingredients. In addition to 
       ingredient-based searches, users can explore recipes by cuisine or dish type, with each recipe including detailed instructions, cooking times, and nutritional info.

       For added convenience, the app may include features like ingredient substitutions, dietary filters (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), and the ability to save favorite recipes for future reference. To make it even more user-friendly, 
       some recipe finders may offer voice or camera input options, allowing users to scan ingredients or speak directly to the app for recipe suggestions. Whether users are looking for quick meals or exploring new cuisines, a recipe 
       finder app makes meal planning simple and enjoyable.</div>
